# LLM-Enhanced Weather Agent Dependencies

# Core dependencies
requests>=2.31.0           # For API calls and Ollama integration
python-dateutil>=2.8.2    # For date/time handling

# Optional dependencies for enhanced functionality
# (Note: LLM-Enhanced agents typically don't use these)
# pandas>=2.0.0            # For data manipulation (not used in LLM-Enhanced)
# numpy>=1.24.0           # For numerical operations (not used in LLM-Enhanced)
# matplotlib>=3.7.0       # For plotting (not used in LLM-Enhanced)

# Development dependencies (optional)
# pytest>=7.4.0         # For testing
# black>=23.0.0         # For code formatting
# flake8>=6.0.0         # For linting

# Note: LLM-Enhanced agents typically have minimal dependencies
# as they rely primarily on LLM capabilities rather than complex
# data processing or tool integration
